# OCR-Optical-Character-Recognition-
Simple Optical Character Recognition programmed in Matlab

This project was made in scope of the course Neural Computation and Diffuse Systems in the University of Coimbra. The objective of this work is to allow a user, in a simple way, to classify a data set of drawn numbers.

I am aware that the network initiator might not be the most used currently, and that this project can be done with far greater success using TensorFlow.

In MAIN.m is explained how to run this project.
